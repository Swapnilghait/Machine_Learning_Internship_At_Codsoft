**Movie Genre Classification Project :**

**Overview**

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts movie genres based on their plot summaries. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to perform genre classification.

**Project Objective**

The primary goal is to build a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting movie genres from textual plot summaries. This project explores various techniques to preprocess text data, extract features, and train a predictive model.

**Features**

Data Collection: Obtained a dataset from [train_data.txt].
Text Preprocessing: Cleaned and tokenized plot summaries, removing noise and irrelevant information.
Feature Extraction: Utilized TF-IDF to transform text data into numerical features.
Model Building: Experimented with Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines for classification.
Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

**Steps Taken**

**1. Data Collection**
Gathered a dataset from [train_data.txt] containing movie plot summaries and genres.

**2. Data Preprocessing**
Cleaned the text data by removing special characters, punctuation, and irrelevant information.
Tokenized the text and converted it to lowercase for consistency.
Removed stop words to improve model accuracy.

**3. Feature Extraction**
Utilized TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features.
Employed techniques to vectorize the textual information to make it usable for machine learning algorithms.

**4. Model Building**
Experimented with various classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.
Trained the model on the processed data to predict movie genres.

**5. Model Evaluation**
Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Fine-tuned the model to improve genre classification accuracy.
