**Machine_Learning_Internship_At_Codsoft**

Welcome to my internship showcase as part of the Codsoft Internship December-January 2023-2024 with codsoft.

Following are the Projects That I have Worked During The Intership :

**Project 1 :**

**Task 1: Movie Genre Classification :**

Task Description: Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

:: The Movie Genre Classification project uses machine learning and natural language processing to predict movie genres from their plot summaries. By analyzing text data and employing various classification algorithms, it aims to accurately assign genres to movies, streamlining categorization and aiding recommendation systems in the entertainment industry. The project's success could simplify content organization and enhance audience targeting, potentially reshaping how movies are categorized and recommended in the digital landscape.
